### üîÅ AgenticAI AI-Powered Indonesian Legal Document Analysis

This project is a FastAPI web application that leverages advanced AI technologies, including Google Gemini (Gemini 2.0), LangChain, and LangGraph, to analyze Indonesian legal documents. Users can upload multiple legal files (PDF, Word, Excel, CSV, etc.), ask detailed questions about the content, and receive accurate, structured answers powered by a custom language model prompt focused on Indonesian law.
- Upload multiple legal documents in various formats.
- Extract and combine content from uploaded files using LangChain's UnstructuredFileLoader.
- Use a custom language model prompt template specialized for interpreting Indonesian legal texts.
- Intelligent question classification to query Wikipedia, academic papers (arXiv), and current events (Tavily) tools if relevant.
- A multi-step LangGraph workflow that classifies questions, searches relevant sources, and summarizes results.
- User-friendly web interface built with FastAPI and Bootstrap.
- Supports detailed and structured responses, focusing on legal analysis, comparisons, summaries, and numeric data interpretation.
- Designed specifically to understand and analyze Indonesian laws and regulations.

### üß† Medical Claims Anti-Fraud Detection System
A dual-pipeline AI system combining LLMs with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Computer Vision + OCR to analyze and detect potential fraud in medical claim submissions. This project focuses on detecting fraudulent activities in medical claims by using both textual and image-based approaches. It is divided into two primary pipelines:
- LLM + RAG Pipeline (main.py): Analyze text documents (e.g. policy PDFs, claim descriptions) to determine fraud risk level (low-risk vs. high-risk).
- Computer Vision + OCR Pipeline (main2.py): Extract and analyze data from uploaded receipts and detect potential tampering or inconsistencies.
