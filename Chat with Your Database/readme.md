# Chat With Your Database

![Application Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MagicDash91/ML-Engineering-Project/main/Chat%20with%20Your%20Database/static/chat.png)

## Overview

This is a web application built using FastAPI that allows users to interact with their databases through natural language queries. The application uses LangChain to generate SQL queries based on user input and executes them against a specified database.

## Features

- **Natural Language Queries**: Users can ask questions in plain English, and the application will generate and execute the corresponding SQL queries.
- **Multiple Database Support**: Currently supports PostgreSQL and MySQL. Additional databases can be added easily.
- **Interactive UI**: A simple and intuitive web interface to input database credentials and questions.
- **Visualization**: Automatically generates charts from query results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- FastAPI
- LangChain
- Matplotlib
- Uvicorn (for running the server)
- Database drivers (e.g., psycopg2 for PostgreSQL, mysql-connector-python for MySQL)

### Additional Notes

- **Static Files**: Ensure that the `static` directory contains the necessary images (`logo.png`, `postgre.png`, `mysql.avif`, etc.) for the UI.
- **Environment Variables**: Make sure to replace `your_google_api_key_here` with your actual Google API key.
- **Dependencies**: You might need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing all the dependencies. Hereâ€™s an example:

  ```plaintext
  fastapi
  langchain
  langchain-experimental
  langchain-community
  langchain-google-genai
  matplotlib
  uvicorn
  psycopg2-binary  # For PostgreSQL
  mysql-connector-python  # For MySQL
