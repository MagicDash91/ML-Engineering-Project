# YouTube Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

The YouTube Sentiment Analysis project is a web application built using FastAPI that allows users to analyze the sentiment of comments from any YouTube video. It leverages the `youtube-comment-downloader` library to fetch comments, performs sentiment analysis using a pre-trained BERT model, and generates word clouds and insights using the Google Gemini API.

## Features

- **Fetch Comments**: Automatically retrieves comments from a given YouTube URL.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the comments using a BERT model fine-tuned for Indonesian language.
- **Word Clouds**: Generates word clouds for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
- **Insights Generation**: Uses the Google Gemini API to generate actionable insights based on the sentiment analysis.
- **PDF Report**: Provides a downloadable PDF report containing the sentiment distribution, word clouds, and insights.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- youtube-comment-downloader
- Pandas
- Polars
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- WordCloud
- Pillow
- FPDF
- Transformers
- Hugging Face Hub
- Google Generative AI
- Markdown

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-sentiment-analysis.git
    cd youtube-sentiment-analysis
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Up API Keys**

    - Obtain an API key for the Google Generative AI from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    - Obtain a Hugging Face token from your [Hugging Face account](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

    Store these keys securely. You can either hardcode them in the `app.py` file or use environment variables.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**

    ```bash
    uvicorn app:app --reload
    ```

2. **Access the Application**

    Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:9000`.

3. **Analyze Sentiment**

    - Enter the YouTube URL of the video you want to analyze.
    - Optionally, add custom stopwords (comma-separated) to exclude certain words from the analysis.
    - Provide a custom question to guide the insights generated by the Google Gemini API.
    - Click the "Analyze" button to start the sentiment analysis.

4. **View Results**

    - **Sentiment Distribution**: A bar chart showing the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
    - **Word Clouds**: Visual representations of the most frequent words in each sentiment category.
    - **Insights**: Actionable insights generated by the Google Gemini API based on the sentiment analysis.
    - **Download PDF Report**: A downloadable PDF containing all the analysis results.
