# Resume Matcher with Google Gemini and FastAPI

This project uses **FastAPI** and **Google Gemini** to build an AI-powered **Resume Matcher** web application. It helps automate the resume screening process by analyzing uploaded resumes and comparing them with a given job description. The results are returned with a match score and detailed analysis in a **clean, readable format**.

## 🚀 Features
- Upload **PDF** or **DOCX** resumes and a **Job Description**.
- **Google Gemini** analyzes the resumes and compares them with the job description.
- Results are displayed with a **match score** and a breakdown of relevant skills, experience, and education.
- Uses **Markdown** for structured, clean output, which is then rendered as HTML.
- User-friendly **FastAPI** backend with **Bootstrap** frontend.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **FastAPI**: For building a fast and efficient backend API.
- **Google Gemini (Chat Generative AI)**: For natural language processing (NLP) and resume analysis.
- **Markdown**: To structure the output of the AI model, which is then converted into readable HTML.
- **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive and sleek UI design.
- **Python 3.x**: The primary programming language.

## 🧑‍💻 Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MagicDash91/ML-Engineering-Project.git
   cd ML-Engineering-Project
Install Dependencies

### 1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/resume-matcher.git
  cd resume-matcher
Install Dependencies

### 2. Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
### 3. Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Set up your Google API key:
Make sure to have a valid API key for Google Gemini. If you don’t have it, you can get it from Google Cloud Console.

In your project, replace api_key with your actual API key in the analyze_resumes function.

### 5. Run the application:

uvicorn main:app --reload
The app will be running at http://127.0.0.1:9000.

### 6. Test the application:
Visit the link above and upload a job description along with resumes (PDF or DOCX format).

The AI will analyze and provide match scores and feedback on each resume.

🤖 How It Works
Upload Resumes: Users can upload multiple resumes in PDF or DOCX format.
Job Description: Users input a job description that the resumes will be evaluated against.
Google Gemini Model: The Google Gemini API is used to analyze how well the resume matches the job description. The system scores each resume and provides a detailed explanation.
Results: The results are displayed as a clean list, where each resume is scored along with the breakdown of relevant skills and experiences.
📄 Example Results
After analysis, the application will return the results in the following format:


Candidate 1
Score: 8/10
Explanation: The candidate has relevant skills and experience in Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning. However, they are missing some specific experience with SQL databases.

Candidate 2
Score: 6/10
Explanation: The candidate has some experience with data analysis but lacks key qualifications in machine learning and data engineering.
